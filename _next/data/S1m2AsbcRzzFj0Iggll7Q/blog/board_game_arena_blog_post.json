While LLMs excel in tasks like language generation and static problem solving, their performance in dynamic, competitive settings remains an area of active investigation. Strategic decision-making under pressure offers a valuable framework for assessing reasoning, adaptability, and interaction capabilities.\n\nWe introduce **Board Game Arena** â€“ a comprehensive research platform that enables the evaluation of LLMs through strategic gameplay. Rather than relying solely on traditional benchmarks, this framework provides insights into how LLMs navigate competition, uncertainty, and complex decision trees.\n\nBuilt on Google's OpenSpiel framework, Board Game Arena serves as a flexible and extensible platform for researchers and developers. By leveraging OpenSpiel's modular design, this framework can be customized to address a diverse range of research questions, enabling the addition of new games, agents, and analysis tools. Its adaptability makes it an invaluable resource for exploring varied aspects of strategic reasoning and decision-making in AI.\n\n## Why Strategic Games Matter for AI Evaluation\n\nStrategic games offer unique evaluation opportunities that traditional benchmarks cannot provide: genuine decision-making under uncertainty. When an LLM plays Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, or Poker, it must:\n\n- Analyze complex game states with multiple possible outcomes\n- Reason about opponent behavior and predict future moves\n- Balance short-term tactics with long-term strategic goals\n- Handle incomplete information and make decisions under pressure\n- Adapt strategies based on opponent responses\n\nThis creates an ideal testing environment for evaluating the strategic reasoning capabilities that will be crucial as LLMs become more integrated into decision-making roles across industries.\n\n## Key Features of Board Game Arena\n\n### Multi-Agent Testing Framework\n\nBoard Game Arena supports comprehensive competitive scenarios:\n\n- **LLM vs Random**: Establish baseline performance against unpredictable opponents.\n- **LLM vs LLM**: Direct strategic competitions between different language models.\n- **Self-Play**: Enable LLMs to develop strategies by playing against themselves.\n- **Cross-Provider Tournaments**: Compare models from different providers within the same game.\n\n### Diverse Game Library\n\nThe framework includes a carefully selected set of games that test different aspects of strategic thinking:\n\n- **`tic_tac_toe`** - Classic spatial reasoning and tactical planning\n- **`connect_four`** - Long-term strategic positioning and pattern recognition\n- **`kuhn_poker`** - Hidden information, bluffing, and probabilistic reasoning\n- **`prisoners_dilemma`** - Cooperation versus competition dynamics\n- **`matching_pennies`** - Zero-sum game theory and randomization strategies\n- **`matrix_rps`** - Rock-paper-scissors with strategic depth\n\nEach game challenges LLMs in unique ways, from spatial reasoning to probabilistic thinking to social dynamics.\n\n### Flexible Inference Architecture\n\nOne of Board Game Arena's key strengths is its dual-backend architecture:\n\n**LiteLLM Backend** - Access to over 100 language models through APIs:\n- **OpenAI**: GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo\n- **Anthropic**: Claude 3, Claude 3.5 Sonnet\n- **Google**: Gemini Pro, Gemma models\n- **Groq**: Ultra-fast Llama 3 and Gemma inference\n- **Together AI**: Llama 3.1, Mixtral, Code Llama\n- **Additional providers**: Supporting over 90 other model providers for comprehensive comparison\n\n**vLLM Backend** - Local GPU inference for:\n- Complete control over model parameters\n- Privacy-sensitive research applications\n- Custom fine-tuned models\n- Cost-effective large-scale experiments\n\nThe system allows researchers to mix different backends within the same experiment, enabling direct comparison between proprietary and open-source models, or between API-based and locally-hosted implementations.\n\n## Reasoning Traces: Understanding AI Decision-Making\n\nA particularly valuable feature of Board Game Arena is its automatic reasoning traces capability. This functionality captures not only what move an LLM made, but also the reasoning behind that decision.\n\n### Data Collection\n\nFor every move made by an LLM agent, Board Game Arena automatically records:\n\n- **Board State**: The exact game position when the decision was made\n- **Agent Reasoning**: The LLM's complete thought process and explanation\n- **Action Context**: The chosen move with full metadata and timing\n- **Decision Patterns**: Categorized reasoning types and strategic approaches\n\n### Example Reasoning Trace\n\nHere is an example of the reasoning traces captured during gameplay:\n\n```\nReasoning Trace #1\n----------------------------------------\nGame: connect_four\nEpisode: 3, Turn: 5\nAgent: litellm_groq/llama3-8b-8192\nAction Chosen: 3\n\nBoard State at Decision Time:\n     . . . . . . .\n     . . . . . . .\n     . . x . . . .\n     . o x . . . .\n     o x o . . . .\n     x o x . . . .\n\nAgent's Reasoning:\n     I need to block the opponent's potential win. They have\n     two pieces in column 2 and if I don't act now, they\n     could get three in a row vertically. Playing column 3\n     also gives me a chance to build my own threat\n     horizontally while staying defensive.\n\nTimestamp: 2025-08-04 14:23:17\n```\n\n### Analysis Tools\n\nBoard Game Arena includes comprehensive analysis capabilities for reasoning traces:\n\n- **Reasoning Categorization**: Automatically classifies thinking patterns (Positional, Blocking, Winning Logic, Opponent Modeling, etc.)\n- **Pattern Visualization**: Word clouds showing common reasoning terms, pie charts of strategy types\n- **Performance Heatmaps**: Visual maps showing move preferences and strategic tendencies\n- **Statistical Analysis**: Quantitative measures of decision-making patterns\n\nThis provides researchers with tools for understanding how different LLMs approach strategic problems, what reasoning patterns correlate with success, and where current models have strategic limitations.\n\n## Distributed Computing and Scalability\n\nBoard Game Arena supports large-scale experiments through distributed computing capabilities:\n\n### Ray Integration\n\n- **Parallel Episodes**: Execute multiple games simultaneously across different cores\n- **Multi-Game Tournaments**: Run complex tournament brackets in parallel\n- **Distributed LLM Inference**: Efficiently batch and distribute model calls\n- **Real-time Monitoring**: Ray dashboard for live experiment tracking\n\n### SLURM Cluster Support\n\nBoard Game Arena integrates seamlessly with SLURM clusters, enabling researchers to conduct large-scale academic experiments with ease.
