The letter highlights the importance of open-source R&D for ensuring the safety, security, and competitiveness of AI in Europe and warns against the consequences of stifling such innovation.\n\n## The Importance of Open-Source AI\n\nThe letter outlines three main reasons why open-source AI is worth protecting:\n\n1. **Safety through transparency:** Open-source AI promotes safety by enabling researchers and authorities to audit model performance, identify risks, and establish mitigations or countermeasures.\n2. **Competition:** Open-source AI allows small to medium enterprises to build on existing models and drive productivity, rather than relying on a few large firms for essential technology.\n3. **Security:** Public and private organizations can adapt open-source models for specialized applications without sharing sensitive data with proprietary firms.\n\n## Concerns with the Draft AI Act\n\nThe draft AI Act may introduce new requirements for foundation models, which could negatively impact open-source R&D in AI. The letter argues that \"one size fits all\" rules will stifle open-source R&D and could:\n\n- Entrench proprietary gatekeepers, often large firms, to the detriment of open-source researchers and developers\n- Limit academic freedom and prevent the European research community from studying models of public significance\n- Reduce competition between model providers and drive investment in AI overseas\n\n## Recommendations for the European Parliament\n\nThe open letter makes three key recommendations:\n\n1. **Ensure open-source R&D can comply with the AI Act:** The Act should promote open-source R&D and recognize the distinctions between closed-source AI models offered as a service and AI models released as open-source code. Where appropriate, the Act should exempt open-source models from regulations intended for closed-source models.\n2. **Impose requirements proportional to risk:** The Act should impose rules for foundation models that are proportional to their actual risk. A \"one size fits all\" framework could make it impossible to field low-risk and open-source models in Europe.\n3. **Establish public research facilities for compute resources:** The EU should establish large-scale supercomputing facilities for AI research, enabling the European research community to study open-source foundation models under controlled conditions with public oversight.\n\n## The Future of AI in Europe\n\nThe letter concludes with a call to action for the European Parliament to consider the points raised and foster a legislative environment that supports open-source R&D. This approach will promote safety through transparency, drive innovation and competition, and accelerate the development of a sovereign AI capability in Europe.\n\nWith numerous esteemed supporters, including the European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS), the Pan-European AI Network of Excellence, and the German AI Association (KI-Bundesverband), the letter serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of protecting open-source AI for the future of Europe.\n\n## Supporters\n\n\n- European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS) - Pan-European AI Network of Excellence\n- German AI Association (KI-Bundesverband) - With more than 400 companies, the largest AI network in Germany\n- **Prof. Jürgen Schmidhuber**: Scientific Director of the Swiss AI Lab IDSIA (USI & SUPSI), Co-Founder & Chief Scientist of NNAISENSE, Inventor of LSTM Networks\n- **Prof. Sepp Hochreiter**: JKU Linz, Inventor of LSTM Networks\n- **Prof. Bernhard Schölkopf**: Director, Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems and ELLIS Institute, Tübingen, Germany\n- **Prof. Serge Belongie**: University of Copenhagen; Director, Pioneer Centre for AI\n- **Prof. Andreas Geiger**: University of Tübingen and Tübingen AI Center\n- **Prof. Irina Rish**: Full Professor at Université de Montréal, Canada Excellence Research Chair (CERC) in Autonomous AI and Canada CIFAR AI Chair, core member of Mila - Quebec AI Institute.\n- **Prof. Antonio Krüger**: CEO of the German Research Center for AI (DFKI) and Professor at the Saarland University\n- **Prof. Kristian Kersting**: Full Professor at Technical University of Darmstadt and Co-Director, Hessian Center for AI (hessian.AI)\n- **Jörg Bienert**: CEO of German AI Association, CPO of Alexander Thamm GmbH\n- **Patrick Schramowski**: Researcher at German Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) and Hessian Center for AI (hessian.AI)\n- **Dr. Jenia Jitsev**: Lab Leader at Juelich Supercomputing Center, Research Center Juelich, Helmholtz Association, ELLIS member\n- **Dr. Sampo Pyysalo**: Research Fellow at the University of Turku, Finland\n- **Robin Rombach**: Co-Developer of Stable Diffusion, PhD Candidate at LMU Munich\n- **Prof. Michael Granitzer**: Chair of Data Science University of Passau, Germany and Coordinator of OpenWebSearch.eu\n- **Prof. Dr. Jens Meiler**: Leipzig University, ScaDS.AI Center for Scalable Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence\n- **Prof. Dr. Martin Potthast**: Leipzig University, ScaDS.AI Center for Scalable Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence, and OpenWebSearch.EU\n- **Prof. Dr. Holger Hoos**: Alexander von Humboldt Professor in AI at RWTH Aachen University (Germany) and Professor of Machine Learning at Universiteit Leiden (Netherlands)\n- **Prof. Dr. Henning Wachsmuth**: Chair of Natural Language Processing at the Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Leibniz University Hannover\n- **Prof. Dr. Wil van der Aalst**: Alexander von Humboldt Professor in Process and Data Science at RWTH Aachen University and Chief Scientist at Celonis\n- **Prof. Dr. Bastian Leibe**: Chair of Computer Vision at RWTH Aachen University (Germany)\n- **Prof. Dr. Martin Grohe**: Chair for Logic and the Theory of Discrete Systems, RWTH University\n- **Prof. Ludwig Schmidt**: Paul G.
