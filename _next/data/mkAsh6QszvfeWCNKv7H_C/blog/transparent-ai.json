{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Towards a transparent AI Future: The Call for less regulatory hurdles on Open-Source AI in Europe","author":"LAION","date":"September 21 2023","previewImg":"/images/blog/laion-blue.png"},"content":"\nFollowing our previous open letter to the European Parliament on the significance of open-source AI, LAION, backed by European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS) and a long list of very impactful AI researchers, we submit this new open letter to the European Parliament:\n\n| [Link to the PDF](/documents/transparent-ai.pdf) |\n|----------|\n\n#### Why Open-Source is the Gold Standard for AI Security\n\nThe transparency of open-source AI is its strength. It ensures robustness and security unmatched by closed systems. Why? Open-source AI benefits from the scrutiny of the global community, allowing vulnerabilities to be detected and fixed promptly. Drawing parallels, we can look at the Linux operating system—a paragon of security and robustness stemming from its open-source nature.\n\n#### Countering Redundancy and Upholding Sustainability\n\nWith the environmental toll of extensive AI training becoming a major concern, open-source models have shown a clear path forward. By minimizing redundant training, they reduce computational and energy overheads, reflecting a commitment to a sustainable future.\n\n#### Ensuring Scientific Reproducibility\n\nReproducibility and validation are key to scientific integrity and progress. Open-source AI models offer full transparency, allowing diverse research groups to independently verify results and claimed functionality. Unlike closed-source alternatives, open-source foundations guarantee stringent standards for the machine learning and AI field. With these open-source foundation models rigorously tested by a vast expert community, AI applications in sectors from healthcare to finance can build on a trusted, scientifically validated base.\n\n#### A Catalyst for Innovation\n\nOpen-source AI has been instrumental in levelling the playing field. Small and mid-sized enterprises can now fine-tune existing models, fostering innovation without the daunting costs of building from scratch. If Europe's ambition is to retain its brightest minds, ensuring uninterrupted access to these resources is non-negotiable.\n\n#### Regulating Application, Not Innovation\n\nThe clarion call from LAION and its supporters is clear—focus regulations on AI's applications, not the foundational technology. By doing so, the EU will nurture innovation while ensuring that AI's real-world applications are ethical, safe, and in line with European values.\n\n#### Incentivizing the Open-Source Paradigm\n\nPerhaps the most potent recommendation in this new letter is the incentivization of open-source AI. It's a win-win. Organizations can release foundational models as open-source, maintaining proprietary rights on fine-tuned versions. This ensures that the broader community benefits from the base models while commercial competitiveness remains intact.\n\n#### The European AI Path Forward\n\nEuropean sovereignty in AI is crucial, and open-source AI research is key to addressing challenges ranging from healthcare to climate change. The future, as outlined in the letter, imagines a Europe at the forefront of AI research, one that champions transparency, security, and sustainability.\n\n#### Supporters\n\n| Name | Description |\n|----------|----------|\n| Board of the European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS): Serge Belongie, Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi, Florence d'Alché-Buc, Nada Lavrac, Neil D.
