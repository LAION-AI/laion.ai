We work with organizations like [IWF](https://www.iwf.org.uk/) and others to continually monitor and validate links in the publicly available LAION datasets. LAION datasets are also validated through intensive filtering tools developed by our community and partner organizations to ensure they are safe and comply with the law.\n\n## Recent developments and maintenance of LAION 5B\n\nYesterday, we received a copy of a report from Stanford that claimed to find links to illegal content in the LAION 5B dataset. We are evaluating the report findings. In an abundance of caution we have taken LAION 5B offline and are working quickly with the IWF and others to remove any links that may still point to suspicious, potentially unlawful content on the public web.\n\nOur goal is to complete maintenance of LAION 5B by the second half of January and hope to republish the dataset at that time. Will keep you posted.\n\n## Our commitment to transparency\n\nOpen datasets must be accessible and transparent to facilitate ethical AI development. Our goal at LAION is to democratize access to AI resources and promote responsible AI research. We believe the safest approach to AI development is through an open system, where transparency and community engagement are key to ensuring ethical standards and legal compliance.
