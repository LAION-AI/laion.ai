{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"title":"About"},"content":"\nWe are a non-profit organization with members from all over the world, aiming to make large-scale machine learning models, datasets and related code available to the general public.\n\n## OUR BELIEF\n\nWe believe that machine learning research and its applications have the potential to have huge positive impacts on our world and therefore should be democratized.\n\n## OUR PRINCIPAL GOALS\n\nReleasing open datasets, code and machine learning models. We want to teach the basics of large-scale ML research and data management. By making models, datasets and code reusable without the need to train from scratch all the time, we want to promote an efficient use of energy and computing ressources to face the challenges of climate change.\n\n## FUNDING\n\nFunded by donations and public research grants, our aim is to open all cornerstone results from such an important field as large-scale machine learning to all interested communities.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
