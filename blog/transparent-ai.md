#### Why Open-Source is the Gold Standard for AI Security

The transparency of open-source AI is its strength. It ensures robustness and security unmatched by closed systems. Why? Open-source AI benefits from the scrutiny of the global community, allowing vulnerabilities to be detected and fixed promptly. Drawing parallels, we can look at the Linux operating system—a paragon of security and robustness stemming from its open-source nature.

#### Countering Redundancy and Upholding Sustainability

With the environmental toll of extensive AI training becoming a major concern, open-source models have shown a clear path forward. By minimizing redundant training, they reduce computational and energy overheads, reflecting a commitment to a sustainable future.

#### A Catalyst for Innovation

Open-source AI has been instrumental in levelling the playing field. Small and mid-sized enterprises can now fine-tune existing models, fostering innovation without the daunting costs of building from scratch. If Europe's ambition is to retain its brightest minds, ensuring uninterrupted access to these resources is non-negotiable.

#### Regulating Application, Not Innovation

The clarion call from LAION and its supporters is clear—focus regulations on AI's applications, not the foundational technology. By doing so, the EU will nurture innovation while ensuring that AI's real-world applications are ethical, safe, and in line with European values.

#### Incentivizing the Open-Source Paradigm

Perhaps the most potent recommendation in this new letter is the incentivization of open-source AI. It's a win-win. Organizations can release foundational models as open-source, maintaining proprietary rights on fine-tuned versions. This ensures that the broader community benefits from the base models while commercial competitiveness remains intact.

#### The European AI Path Forward

European sovereignty in AI is crucial, and open-source AI research is key to addressing challenges ranging from healthcare to climate change. The future, as outlined in the letter, imagines a Europe at the forefront of AI research, one that champions transparency, security, and sustainability.
