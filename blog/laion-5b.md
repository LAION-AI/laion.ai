We present a dataset of 5,85 billion CLIP-filtered image-text pairs, 14x bigger than LAION-400M, previously the biggest openly accessible image-text dataset in the world - see also our [NeurIPS2022 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08402)

[See our update](/notes/laion-maintanence.md) on the LAION-5B dataset.
