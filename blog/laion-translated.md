Author: [Marianna Nezhurina](https://github.com/marianna13) [Romain Beaumont](https://github.com/rom1504/) [Richard Vencu](https://github.com/rvencu) [Christoph Schuhmann](https://github.com/christophschuhmann)  

Laion5B dataset was automatically collected from a section of the human web (common crawl). Can models generate different and interesting data compared to what humans write?

That’s a question we are interested in investigating. To let the community study it, we translated 3B samples of Laion5B from many languages into English.

We released 3 billions captions for the multilingual part of Laion5B. This makes it possible to use the whole Laion5B dataset to train English models. This also enables training models using these aligned pairs such as [Multilingual-CLIP](https://github.com/FreddeFrallan/Multilingual-CLIP).

We’re curious what you will do using it!


## Downloading it

The dataset is available in huggingface as parquet files containing the caption, translated caption and urls.

[laion2B-multi-joined-translated-to-en](https://huggingface.co/datasets/laion/laion2B-multi-joined-translated-to-en)  


## Processing

Every caption of the original dataset was translated with Facebook’s [M2M100 1.2B model](https://huggingface.co/facebook/m2m100_1.2B) using the following [script](https://github.com/marianna13/translate_dataset/blob/main/translate_data.py). All other fields remain the same as in the original [LAION2B Multi Joined](https://huggingface.co/datasets/laion/laion2B-multi-joined). To make translation possible the original dataset was split into parts with 50k samples in each and every such small part was translated in parallel on GPU nodes and saved in a separate parquet file. The speed of translation depends on the number of nodes and GPUs. The processing was done with 20 nodes with 8 GPUs in each and the speed of translation (including preprocessing and data loading) is 34 samples/per GPU/per second. Then, all translated parquets were [merged together using Spark](https://github.com/marianna13/translate_dataset/blob/main/join_additional.py) and saved as 128 parquet files. The resulting dataset was [joined with the aesthetics scores](https://github.com/marianna13/translate_dataset/blob/main/join_aesthetics.py). 


## Dataset columns



* TEXT (the original text of caption)
* LANGUAGE (language of the original TEXT)
* ENG TEXT (translation in English of the original TEXT)
* URL (URL of the image)
* WIDTH (width of the image)
* HEIGHT (height of the image)
* Hash (hash of the URL and TEXT)
* Pwatermark (probability of being a watermarked image, computed using our [watermark detector](https://github.com/LAION-AI/LAION-5B-WatermarkDetection))
* Punsafe (probability of being an unsafe image, computed using our [clip based detector](https://github.com/LAION-AI/CLIP-based-NSFW-Detector))
* Similarity (cosine between text and image ViT-B/32 embeddings, clip for en, mclip for multi and nolang)
* Prediction (aesthetics score)

### Similarities between text and images

10000 images and captions were sampled from the dataset, [CLIP embeddings were computed](https://github.com/marianna13/translate_dataset/blob/main/get_clip_embs_similarities.py) (for original texts embeddings were computed using Multilingual CLIP). Then dot products between image and text embeddings were computed (for both original and translated dataset) to get similarities between texts and images. Here’s the distribution of average similarities for two datasets:

## Laion1B-nolang-translated

[LAION1B Nolang Joined](https://huggingface.co/datasets/laion/laion1B-nolang-joined) dataset was also translated with a similar [script](https://github.com/marianna13/translate_dataset/tree/main) and in the same way as Multi. This dataset doesn’t have the language column so the model also had to determine language. All other columns in the Nolang dataset are the same as in Multi. And just like translated [LAION2B Multi Joined](https://huggingface.co/datasets/laion/laion2B-multi-joined), LAION1B Nolang was also joined with corresponding [aesthetics scores](https://github.com/marianna13/translate_dataset/blob/main/join_aesthetics.py).

### Similarities between text and images for Nolang

10000 images and captions were randomly sampled from the dataset, [CLIP embeddings were computed](https://github.com/marianna13/translate_dataset/blob/main/get_clip_embs_similarities.py) (for original texts embeddings were computed using Multilingual CLIP). Then dot products between image and text embeddings were computed (for both original and translated dataset) to get similarities between texts and images.
