They provide a lot of information, but could synthetic captions complement them ?\n\nTo answer this question, we use a combination of existing, publicly available models to produce high quality captions for images in the style of [MS COCO](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/coco).\n\nWe captioned 600M images from the english subset of Laion-5B with an ensemble of [BLIP](https://github.com/salesforce/BLIP) L/14 and 2 CLIP versions (L/14 and RN50x64).  \n\nWith this post we release them openly today.\n\nThis will make it possible to investigate the value of generated captions to train models. We’re curious on how these synthetic captions could impact models trained on them!\n\n\n## Download it\n\nThe 600M samples are provided in parquet files. Columns include the original caption, the url, the top caption and a list of alternative captions with lower CLIP-similarity scores.\n\n[https://huggingface.co/datasets/laion/laion-coco](https://huggingface.co/datasets/laion/laion-coco) \n\n\n## Samples\n\n\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/images/blog/ring.png\" style=\"height:250px; width: auto;\"/\u003e\n\n\n**Original:** LGSY 925 Sterling Silver Double Heart Rings Infinity Love Thin Rings Wedding Engagement Promise Engraved Love Rings for Women for Dainty Gift\n\n**Generated:** An open ring with two hearts on it.\n\n\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/images/blog/boot.png\" style=\"height:250px; width: auto;\"/\u003e\n         \n\n**Original:** Female Thick with Pointy Head High Heel Chelsea Ankle Boots\n\n**Generated:** Red leather ankle boots with gold buckles.\n\n\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/images/blog/laion_coco_beach.png\" style=\"height:250px; width: auto;\"/\u003e\n\n\n**Original:** a group of people on horses on a beach\n\n**Generated:** Several people riding horses down the beach on a cloudy day.\n\n\n\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/images/blog/laion_coco_tags.png\" style=\"height:250px; width: auto;\"/\u003e\n\n\n**Original:** a wall with a bunch of graffiti on it\n\n**Generated:** The parking meter is near a graffiti covered building.\n\n                                                                                                                                        \n\n\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/images/blog/sheeple.png\" style=\"height:250px; width: auto;\"/\u003e\n\n\n**Original:** sheeple family\n\n**Generated:** A cartoon drawing of sheep watching TV with their babies.\n\n\n## More samples of images with their generated captions can be found here: \n\n(no cherry picking)\n\n[http://captions.christoph-schuhmann.de/eval_laion/eval.html](http://captions.christoph-schuhmann.de/eval_laion/eval.html) \n\n\n## Method\n\nThe method we used to generate these captions was to\n\n1. We use Blip L/14 to generate 40 captions\n2. Rank them using openai Clip Open AI L/14 ; selected the best 5 captions\n3. Rank using Open AI RN50x64 Clip model to select the best one\n4. Use a small, fine-tuned T0 model to roughly repair grammar and punctuation of the texts\n\nThe hyperparameters were chosen through a [grid search](https://wandb.ai/andreaskoepf/blip_coco_val_sample_sweep_bayes_02/sweeps/1bsha6b0) ([settings](https://github.com/andreaskoepf/CLIP-Image-Captioning/blob/blip_test/blip_coco_val_sample_sweep_bayes_02.yaml)) by Andreas Köpf to best match the style ( ROUGE scores ) of MS COCO texts.\n\n[laion_idle_cap](https://github.com/andreaskoepf/laion_idle_cap/tree/main/docker) is the script that was used for this processing.\n\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWe evaluated these generated captions by asking human evaluators to guess whether a caption is coming from a human or an AI model. We also asked them to rate the quality on a scale from 0(bad) to 5 (good). \n\nIn a first round we presented the evaluators each 200 samples, that contained 100 AI generated and 100 human written MS COCO captions.\n\n### Observations\n\n \n\n\u003cimg src=\"/images/blog/eval_laion_coco.png\" style=\"width:400px\" /\u003e\n\n\nGT: Y-Axis\n\nAnnotation: X-Axis\n\nMean rating \u0026 standard deviation of samples, that were written by a human:\n\nMean: 3.98\n\nStdev: 0.99\n\nMean rating \u0026 standard deviation of samples, that were written by an AI \n\nMean: 3.89\n\nStdev: 1.12\n\nMean rating \u0026 standard deviation of samples, where the annotator believed they were written by a human:\n\nMean: 4.44\n\nStdev: 0.61\n\nMean rating \u0026 standard deviation of samples, where the annotator believed they were generated by an AI \n\nMean: 3.50\n\nStdev: 1.15\n\n### Interpretation\n\nIt is very interesting that the mean scores of the samples generated by humans and generated by the model are very similar. We also notice that the standard deviation of the generated captions is a little bit higher.\n\nWe hypothesize that most in most cases the quality of the generated captions is perceived as as good as the quality of the human written captions.\n\nBut sometimes the captioning model obviously fails and the quality of the results is pretty low because the model doesn't relevant understand concepts about what is going on in the picture, because it's knowledge is not grounded in a sufficiently sophisticated world model.\n\n### Failure cases\n\n\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/images/blog/laion_coco_umbrella.png\" style=\"height:250px; width: auto;\"/\u003e\n\n\n_“Two people posing for the camera in their wedding attire, one with an umbrella over his head and another with long red hair.”_\n\n\n\n\u003cimg src=\"/images/blog/laion_coco_man.png\" style=\"height:250px; width: auto;\"/\u003e\n\n\n_“An older man having a heart attack, with his hand on the chest.”_\n\nWhen we remove all samples from the evaluations that have ratings of either 0 or 1, we Observe that the mean ratings and standard deviations move closer together. \n\n### Scores without ratings of 0 and 1\n\nMean rating \u0026 standard deviation of samples, that were written by a human:\n\nMean: 4.07\n\nStdev: 0.81\n\nMean rating \u0026 standard deviation of samples, that were written by an AI \n\nMean: 4.02\n\nStdev: 0.94\n\nThe mean ratings of the generated captions are still a little bit lower and the standard deviation is still a little bit higher, but the trend is pretty clear. By removing samples with rating 2, the gap between the qualities would probably decrease even further. \n\nPresentation only generated captions:\n\nIn a next step, we presented the human evaluators 400 captions that were only generated by the model (no human written captions in between):\n\nMean rating of all samples \n\n3.81\n\nStandard deviation of all samples \n\n0.94\n\n% rated as human\n\n47.5\n\n% rated as AI\n\n52.5\n\nWe observe that the human evaluators thought in 47.5% of all cases, that the captions were written by a human. This makes us confident that our captains are on average pretty good. When we told the evaluators later that all captions were generated by the model they told us that it was very hard for them to judge whether a caption was written by a model or a human, and that it only was easy for them in obvious failure cases.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nWe conclude that Our ensemble of BLIP and CLIP is already pretty good and capable of generating captions with a quality that is on average pretty close to the human written captions of MS Coco. \n\nIt would be very interesting for future work to let people rate our generated captions at larger scale and then filter out the samples with low rating values. These results could be used to train models to rate the quality of captions and to predict whether a caption looks like a generated or a human written caption.\n\nAnd even without further automated filtering, an ensemble of our captions and human evaluators would be a pretty good workflow to curate high quality captions at much lower costs than if we would ask humans to write them from scratch.\n\n\n## Credit assignments\n\n\n\n* [Christoph Schuhmann](https://github.com/christophschuhmann) lead the project, implemented a first version of the code, ran most of the generations \u0026 conducted the human evaluations\n* [Andreas Köpf](https://github.com/andreaskoepf) conducted the hyperparameter search \u0026 wrote the code to execute BLIP + CLIP filtering at scale\n* [Theo Coombes](https://github.com/TheoCoombes) managed the server that coordinated which GPU worker got which part of LAION to work on\n* [Romain Beaumont](https://github.com/rom1504) packaged the .json into parquet files, sent to HF and wrote the first draft of this post\n* [Richard Vencu](https://github.com/rvencu/) provided the infra structure to use the idle compute for this project\n* [Benjamin Trom](https://github.com/limiteinductive) wrote code that help us to convert the .json files to parquet\n\nWe thank [stability.ai](https://stability.ai/) for providing the compute used to generate the captions in the dataset.\n","date":1663200000000},{"slug":"laion-translated","frontmatter":{"title":"Laion translated: 3B captions translated to English from laion5B","author":"Marianna Nezhurina, Romain Beaumont, Richard Vencu and Christoph Schuhmann","date":"Sep 15, 2022","previewImg":"/images/blog/laion-translated-samples.png"},"content":"\nAuthor: [Marianna Nezhurina](https://github.com/marianna13) [Romain Beaumont](https://github.com/rom1504/) [Richard Vencu](https://github.com/rvencu) [Christoph Schuhmann](https://github.com/christophschuhmann)  \n\nLaion5B dataset was automatically collected from a section of the human web (common crawl).

To let the community study it, we translated 3B samples of Laion5B from many languages into English.\n\nWe released 3 billions captions for the multilingual part of Laion5B. This makes it possible to use the whole Laion5B dataset to train English models.

All other fields remain the same as in the original [LAION2B Multi Joined](https://huggingface.co/datasets/laion/laion2B-multi-joined). To make translation possible the original dataset was split into parts with 50k samples in each and every such small part was translated in parallel on GPU nodes and saved in a separate parquet file. The speed of translation depends on the number of nodes and GPUs. The processing was done with 20 nodes with 8 GPUs in each and the speed of translation (including preprocessing and data loading) is 34 samples/per GPU/per second.

The H/14 model achieves **78.0%** zero shot top-1 accuracy on ImageNet and **73.4%** on zero-shot image retrieval at Recall@5 on MS COCO. As of September 2022, this is the best open source CLIP model.\n\nCLIP makes it possible to compute representations of images and texts to measure how **similar** they are. It can be used for \n\n\n\n* Zero shot classification: compare an image with the text of the class to know which class is most similar (e.g., ImageNet classification)\n* Retrieval: compare an image or a text to billions of text or images to find the most similar (e.g. as in [clip-retrieval](https://rom1504.github.io/clip-retrieval/) )\n* Generation\n    * CLIP guidance: decide a text you want to generate, then use an image generator model, and use the CLIP distance between what’s generated and the text to generate a better image (e.g., VQGAN + CLIP)\n    * CLIP conditioning: use a clip text embedding as input of a generator to make it generate this text directly (e.g., stable diffusion)\n\nCLIP models are trained in a self supervised fashion on hundreds of millions or billions of (image, text) pairs.\n\nWith LAION, we produced the LAION-5B dataset that contains 5.8 billions of closely related image and text pairs.\n\nThe CLIP model ViT B/32, released by OpenAI, was initially used to filter this dataset out of common crawl.\n\nProducing the best open source CLIP model out of this data set completes the open source replication of the [excellent](https://openai.com/blog/clip/) CLIP paper that OpenAI released one year ago.\n\n\n## Results\n\nWe replicated the results from openai CLIP in models of different sizes, then trained bigger models. The full evaluation suite on 39 datasets ([vtab+](https://github.com/LAION-AI/CLIP_benchmark)) are available in this [results notebook](https://github.com/LAION-AI/CLIP_benchmark/blob/main/benchmark/results.ipynb) and show consistent improvements over all datasets.\n\nThe larger models we release today are L/14, H/14 and g/14.\n\nL/14 was trained on JUWELS Booster supercomputer by [Ross wightman](https://github.com/rwightman). H/14 and g/14 were trained on stability cluster by [Romain Beaumont](https://github.com/rom1504) . While L/14 and H/14 were trained using 34B samples from LAION-2b, g/14 used a substantially smaller sample scale for training, seeing only 12B samples (see tables for more details).\n\n\n#### 32B samples seen\n\n\n| **Model name**                                                                   | **Batch size**                   | **Samples seen**           | **Text Params** | **Image params** | **Imagenet top1** | **Mscoco image retrieval at 5** | **Flickr30k image retrieval at 5** |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| [B/32](https://wandb.ai/rom1504/eval_openclip/reports/B-32-2B--VmlldzoyNDkwNDMy) | 79k                              | 34B (16 epochs of laion2B) | 63.43M          | 87.85M           | 66.6%             | 65.4%                           | 88.4%                              |\n| L/14                                                                             | 79k for 14B samples, 86K for 18B | 32B                        | 123.65M         | 303.97M          | 75.3%             | 71.1%                           | 92.9%                              |\n| [H/14](https://wandb.ai/rom1504/eval_openclip/reports/H-14--VmlldzoyNDAxODQ3)    | 79k                              | 32B (16 epochs of laion2B) | 354.03M         | 632.08M          | 78.0%             | 73.4%                           | 94%                                |\n\n\n\n#### 12B samples seen\n\n\n| **Model name**                                                                     | **Batch size**                             | **Samples seen**                        | **Text Params** | **Image params** | **Imagenet top1** | **Mscoco image retrieval at 5** | **Flickr30k image retrieval at 5** |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| B/32                                                                               | 32k                                        | 12B (32 epochs of laion400m)            | 63.43M          | 87.85M           | 62.9%             | 60.8%                           | 85.5%                              |\n| B/16                                                                               | 32k                                        | 12B (32 epochs of laion400m)            | 91.16M          | 86.19M           | 69%               | 63.6%                           | 85.5%                              |\n| L/14                                                                               | 32k                                        | 12B (32 epochs of laion400m)            | 123.65M         | 303.97M          | 72%               | 68.1%                           | 90.8%                              |\n| [g/14](https://wandb.ai/rom1504/eval_openclip/reports/slow-g-14--VmlldzoyNTMwMjg5) | 32k for 8B samples then 64k for 4B samples | 12B (similar to 32 epochs on laion400m) | 354.03M         | 1012.65M         | 76.6%             | 72.4%                           | 93.5%                              |\n\n\nIn addition to having overall better results, we hope the larger text encoder will help improve text understanding. The good performance on the retrieval metrics seems to be a good indicator of this property.\n\nNote the difference in samples seen between the H/14 and the g/14 model. This explains the difference in performance. We picked this lower number to try and fix the stability issue at a lower cost. Eventually they were fixed (by using bfloat16). The performance of this model falls in the scaling curve of 12B sample seen (similar to 32 epochs of laion400m), and a g/14 trained on 32B samples of laion2B would most likely follow the same trends as the other models and get better performance as H/14.\n\n![alt_text](/images/blog/compare3.png \"image_tooltip\")\n\n\n\n## Released checkpoints\n\nWe release the checkpoints for the models, they are available through [openclip](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip) and in HuggingFace hub at [B/32](https://huggingface.co/laion/CLIP-ViT-B-32-laion2B-s34B-b79K) [L/14](https://huggingface.co/laion/CLIP-ViT-L-14-laion2B-s32B-b82K) [H/14](https://huggingface.co/laion/CLIP-ViT-H-14-laion2B-s32B-b79K) and [g/14](https://huggingface.co/laion/CLIP-ViT-g-14-laion2B-s12B-b42K)\n\n\n## Related works\n\nRelated work results:\n\n\n| **Model name** | **Samples seen**       | **Imagenet top1** | **Mscoco image retrieval at 5** | **Flickr30k image retrieval at 5** |\n|----------------|------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Openai B/32    | 12B (32 epochs of WIT) | 62%               |                                 |                                    |\n| Openai B/16    | 12B (32 epochs of WIT) | 69%               |                                 |                                    |\n| Openai L/14    | 12B (32 epochs of WIT) | 75.4%             | 61%                             | 87%                                |\n| ALIGN          | 20B                    | 76.4%             | 69.8%                           | 93.3%                              |\n| BASIC          | 32B                    | 85.7%             |                                 |                                    |\n| CoCa           | 32B                    | 86.3%             | 74.2%                           | 95.7%                              |\n\n\n[BASIC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10050) and  [ALIGN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05918) got excellent imagenet results. They used either different image encoder architecture (EfficientNet, CoAtNet), a larger network scale (BASIC-L with 2.4B params) or pre trained their network with supervised learning on a large dataset (BASIC CoAtNet vision encoder).\n\n[COCA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01917) additionally used captioning loss during training with a multi-modal text decoder which predicted text tokens autoregressively and got 86.3% top1, employing a larger model scale (2.1B params)\n\n\n## Scaling up notes\n\nDuring these training runs, we encountered several interesting issues:\n\n\n\n* Using many GPUs means many of them can have hardware issues and can freeze, crash or even just be slow. This is a particularly annoying problem to handle as if one GPU has an issue, the synchronized nature of distributed training means that all GPUs get stuck. I created [https://github.com/rom1504/gpu-tester](https://github.com/rom1504/gpu-tester) to figure out what are the bad GPUs and exclude them\n* Stability issues! When scaling up the model size, the batch size and the dataset size, at around half the training the loss starts increasing until it reaches a plateau. We tried many possible things (find the list [there](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EFbMLRWSSV0LUf9Du1pWzWqgeiIRPwEWX2s1C6mAk5c/edit)) and eventually concluded on a surprisingly simple solution: **using amp bfloat16 instead of amp float16 made the training fully stable**\n\nAnd also made some discoveries:\n\n\n\n* It seems using a very large batch size (up to 159k) can help reach even higher performance. This is most likely due to the fact that contrastive learning provides information to the loss as a logit matrix, hence having N times more samples in a batch means N square logits. We did not verify this systematically but BASIC paper provides more experiments and a theoretical justification for this result.\n* It’s possible to get a reasonably performing g/14 CLIP by doing a much shorter cosine decay =\u003e getting a 68% g/14 in 10k gpu hours.\n* Grad checkpointing allows to do 10x on the batch size\n\n\n### Training stability issues\n\nStability of training was the main problem we solved in this iteration of the scaling up of OpenCLIP. At around half the training (for L/14, H/14 and g/14), the loss started going up until it plateaued very high (11) and didn’t go down anymore.\n\nWe tried many possible fixes (decreasing lr, gradient shrinking, gradient clipping, cosine attention, post layer norm, …) with little to no effect when trying to resume from before the crash. \n\nEventually only 2 things worked:\n\n\n\n* Finishing the  lr decay very fast : in 8 epochs (compared to the planned 256 epochs). That managed to get most of the performance out of clip H. \n* Switching from float16 to bfloat16 solved the problem while being faster for clip g. We then applied the same fix for clip H and finished its training properly.\n\n[See all the training notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EFbMLRWSSV0LUf9Du1pWzWqgeiIRPwEWX2s1C6mAk5c/edit) with all the details on all the possible ideas that didn’t work.\n\n\n### Training speeds\n\nTo better understand the cost and length of training of clip, we provide these training speed numbers. All numbers assume a100 with 40GB of VRAM. We used gradient checkpointing.\n\n| Model                                                                           | Batch size per gpu | Precision | Number of gpus | Sample per second per gpu |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------|----------------|---------------------------|\n| [B/32](https://wandb.ai/rom1504/open-clip/runs/rnxrp6k7?workspace=user-rom1504) | 96                 | float16   | 824            | 228                       |\n| [H/14](https://wandb.ai/rom1504/open-clip/runs/2zphcgkn?workspace=user-rom1504) | 96                 | float16   | 824            | 30                        |\n| [g/14](https://wandb.ai/rom1504/open-clip/runs/21cpomx2?workspace=user-rom1504) | 40                 | float16   | 800            | 20                        |\n| [H/14](https://wandb.ai/rom1504/open-clip/runs/3l7ppqh3?workspace=user-rom1504) | 96                 | bfloat16  | 824            | 42                        |\n| [g/14](https://wandb.ai/rom1504/open-clip/runs/1pby5fkb?workspace=user-rom1504) | 80                 | bfloat16  | 800            | 31                        |\n\n\nThe speed usually increases with batch size per gpu until a plateau is reached. The speed also increases with the number of gpu. After a certain number of gpus, the curve becomes slower than linear.\n\nBfloat16 which we used in the second part of training provides both better stability and faster sample/s for clip models.\n\n\n## What’s next\n\nThe models will be used for many applications, including clip guiding and conditioning. Even better results could be reached on models like stable diffusion by using a better clip model!\n\nNow that the scaling properties of clip are proven in an open source reproduction, a lot of doors open. Here are some ideas of next steps:\n\n\n\n* Changing the text encoder to work in the multilingual setting (to get a model like [Multilingual-CLIP](https://github.com/FreddeFrallan/Multilingual-CLIP) but trained contrastively, with hopefully even better results!) and scale it up\n* Can we get clip models while using less gpu hours ? extracting the knowledge from smaller clips into a bigger one may help bootstrap the learning process (see [encoder-distill](https://github.com/iejMac/encoder-distill) from [iejMac](https://github.com/iejMac) getting some preliminary results on this)  \n* The clip idea can be expanded to other modalities, see [CLAP](https://github.com/LAION-AI/CLAP) for text-audio alignment\n\nIf you have ideas or want to help out, feel free to reach out in laion server.\n\n\n## Contributions\n\nThanks to\n\n\n\n* [Romain Beaumont](https://github.com/rom1504) for running the experiments on H/14 and g/14\n* [Ross Wightman](https://github.com/rwightman) for conducting all the openclip experiments at JUWELS Booster (Juelich Supercomputing Center) up to L/14 and providing valuable feedback during these H and g clip trainings\n* [Phil Wang](https://github.com/lucidrains) for providing ideas and code (cosine attention, post layer norm, ..) during the stability issues\n* [Boris Dayma](https://github.com/borisdayma) and [Mitchell Wortsman](https://mitchellnw.github.io/) for both proposing to try float32 that showed precision was an issue and eventually lead to trying bfloat16\n* [Blinkdl](https://github.com/Blinkdl) for proposing interesting ideas regarding tuning the learning rate\n* [Christoph Schuhmann](https://github.com/christophschuhmann) for daring proposing to train such large clips, following up on all these experiments, and finding very early that training were frozen, saving some valuable time\n* [Jenia Jitsev](https://github.com/JeniaJitsev) for providing ideas and feedback during the training issues, supervision and coordination of the compute grants at JUWELS Booster\n* [Ludwig Schmidt](https://github.com/ludwigschmidt) for reviewing this post and giving many ideas about LAION datasets and CLIP \n* [Mehdi Cherti](https://github.com/mehdidc) for helping to debug the evaluation scripts and getting comparable results for MS-COCO\n\nAnd of course [Emad](https://twitter.com/EMostaque) (Stability AI) for providing the many GPUs used during these experiments!

Our recommendation is therefore to use the dataset for research purposes. Be aware that this large-scale dataset is uncurated. Keep in mind that the uncurated nature of the dataset means that collected links may lead to strongly discomforting and disturbing content for a human viewer. Therefore, please use the demo links with caution and at your own risk. It is possible to extract a “safe” subset by filtering out samples based on the safety tags (using a customized trained NSFW classifier that we built). While this strongly reduces the chance for encountering potentially harmful content when viewing, we cannot entirely exclude the possibility for harmful content being still present in safe mode, so that the warning holds also there. We think that providing the dataset openly to broad research and other interested communities will allow for transparent investigation of benefits that come along with training large-scale models as well as pitfalls and dangers that may stay unreported or unnoticed when working with closed large datasets that remain restricted to a small community. Providing our dataset openly, we however **do not recommend using it for creating ready-to-go industrial products, as the basic research about general properties and safety of such large-scale models, which we would like to encourage with this release, is still in progress**.\n\n## Introduction\n\nSince the release of CLIP \u0026 DALL-E in January 2021, several similar large multi-modal language-vision models have been trained by large groups. Models like FLORENCE, Turing Bletchley, ALIGN \u0026 BASIC demonstrated very strong transfer capabilities on novel datasets in absence of per-sample labels, which also steadily improved when growing training data amount, following scaling laws observed in previous research work. These models require billions of image-text pairs to achieve competitive performances and unfortunately, no billion-scale image-text pair dataset had been openly available up until now. To address this problem we release LAION 5B, a CLIP-filtered dataset of 5,85 billion high-quality image-text pairs, their CLIP ViT-L/14 embeddings, kNN-indices, a web interface for exploration \u0026 subset-creation and NSFW- and watermark-detection scores and tools. We describe the procedure to create the dataset and demonstrate successful training of DALL-E architecture.

More than 0.8 for watermark. These values are pretty conservative, so the estimated safeness and watermark proportion may be higher than the truth. Other thresholds may be chosen to get a different precision/recall tradeoff.\n\nComputed quantiles are quantiles from 0.05 to 0.95.\n\nAlso see the whole [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19AkcufyABAnbBlsr12VUmlR9oyQWb4uloAQnd-rqJC0/edit#gid=0) and the whole [dashboard](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/c67c1749-816f-464f-873a-867b4a43f044/page/p_i9he8sxntc/edit)\n\n### Laion2B-en\n\nTotal: 2.3B samples\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-SW3vGI4_Ojemg_ttYpZvFmC8vTjYavTDgmnY7SsnfF-smnVpLwqbYCUsmB9_1HBmmVbKRE2QXJRwxamNcw1A9sRXDFPSj0YZ2WiptPnNeAMuSF0O_2Yi_CGsm_QChM4eJXd4lyY)\n\nNumber with height and width bigger than\n\n- 256 -\u003e 1324M\n- 512 -\u003e 488M\n- 1024 -\u003e 76M\n\nWidth quantiles: 132.0, 160.0, 180.0, 210.0, 225.0, 240.0, 262.0, 300.0, 309.0, 340.0, 400.0, 450.0, 480.0, 512.0, 600.0, 656.0, 760.0, 960.0, 1050.0\n\nHeight quantiles: 125.0, 150.0, 166.0, 188.0, 208.0, 225.0, 250.0, 270.0, 300.0, 320.0, 350.0, 380.0, 418.0, 470.0, 500.0, 600.0, 672.0, 800.0, 1014.0\n\nUnsafe proportion: 2.9%\n\nWatermark proportion: 6.1%\n\nAverage text length: 67\n\nText length quantiles: 21.0, 25.0, 30.0, 33.0, 37.0, 40.0, 43.0, 47.0, 50.0, 54.0, 58.0, 62.0, 67.0, 72.0, 78.0, 85.0, 96.0, 114.0, 152.0\n\n### Laion2B-multi\n\nTotal: 2.2B samples\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/jLZYO_GMS28fzxwfZS199LOjSeUpTH7HEmjIRwyVAtvJdBkzyHzs83FgnD-hOY0CjK8LDooytibVcbuVa_O5YSoCu1IduEj4Z8uneE8Km-0Y39qHzYAJs4Lr4oEyQh4EeWxHGFOk)\n\nNumber with height and width bigger than\n\n- 256 -\u003e 1299M\n- 512 -\u003e 480M\n- 1024 -\u003e 57M\n\nWidth quantiles: 140.0, 160.0, 188.0, 205.0, 235.0, 250.0, 284.0, 300.0, 324.0, 366.0, 420.0, 480.0, 520.0, 600.0, 640.0, 720.0, 800.0, 960.0, 1080.0\n\nHeight quantiles: 120.0, 144.0, 160.0, 180.0, 200.0, 217.0, 240.0, 262.0, 300.0, 320.0, 350.0, 394.0, 416.0, 458.0, 500.0, 564.0, 636.0, 725.0, 1000.0\n\nTop 10 languages: LANGUAGE count proportion:\n\n- ru 241M 0.106\n- fr 168M 0.074\n- de 150M 0.066\n- es 149M 0.066\n- zh 143M 0.063\n- ja 131M 0.057\n- it 95M 0.042\n- pt 88M 0.038\n- nl 66M 0.029\n- pl 62M 0.027\n- no 49M 0.021\n\nUnsafe proportion: 3.3%\n\nWatermark proportion: 5.6%\n\nAverage text length: 52\n\nText length quantiles: 12.0, 16.0, 20.0, 23.0, 27.0, 30.0, 33.0, 37.0, 40.0, 44.0, 48.0, 52.0, 57.0, 61.0, 67.0, 74.0, 81.0, 93.0, 120.0\n\n### Laion1B-nolang\n\nTotal: 1.2B samples\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mAI2e-sLE2geRsX8-3Mw-Ye_8wDu0SEDnIBZjWNqJiaAdjtjj7PtBvRhreugGS6_740-KcILnRbvRbDcTIFccrYO-adNz2uRM6zb0VgR3wjZVo_x0dxDhaMouH2KHScZnuNNkvs3)\n\nNumber with height and width bigger than\n\n- 256 -\u003e 1324M\n- 512 -\u003e 488M\n- 1024 -\u003e 76M\n\nWidth quantiles: 135.0, 160.0, 181.0, 207.0, 225.0, 241.0, 264.0, 300.0, 306.0, 338.0, 398.0, 426.0, 499.0, 520.0, 600.0, 655.0, 768.0, 940.0, 1080.0\n\nHeight quantiles: 118.0, 144.0, 160.0, 186.0, 200.0, 220.0, 240.0, 260.0, 292.0, 305.0, 338.0, 368.0, 405.0, 456.0, 500.0, 562.0, 637.0, 768.0, 1000.0\n\nUnsafe proportion: 3%\n\nWatermark proportion: 4%\n\nAverage text length: 46\n\nText length quantiles: 13.0, 17.0, 20.0, 23.0, 26.0, 29.0, 32.0, 35.0, 38.0, 41.0, 44.0, 48.0, 51.0, 56.0, 60.0, 67.0, 73.0, 82.0, 99.0\n\n## Acquisition pipeline\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/5Pcm38fU3jxc9zf1oSNLMTxh9TH4eMG-5n-dwLF-EPNc_o-jRCwa1D1AJIX-dP4UmeEoKkDxg4fWr3Mq5JwQ7TDuKUwMiaww9GPh8EGJwGkCqWXWKx15CY4Jgige8Uu6inl0KSOu)\n\nThe acquisition pipeline follows the flowchart above and can be split into three major components:\n\n- Distributed processing of petabyte-scale Common Crawl dataset, which produces a collection of matching URLs and captions (preprocessing phase)\n- The distributed download of images based on shuffled data to pick a correct distribution of URLs, to avoid too heavy request loads on single websites\n- Few GPU node post-processing of the data, which is much lighter and can be run in a few days, producing the final dataset.\n\n### Distributed processing of Common Crawl\n\nTo create image-text pairs, we parse through WAT files from Common Crawl and parse out all HTML IMG tags containing an alt-text attribute. At the same time, we perform a language detection on text with three possible outputs: English language with confidence, another language with confidence, no language which contains “no detection” and “detection under the confidence threshold”. The “no language” set often contains short texts, mostly with names of people and places. All extracted information by the preprocessing workers were packed and sent to the Postgresql node for storage using the COPY command. The Postgresql server was maintained to keep about 500M records at all times by means of balancing the ingress and egress of data from the database.\n\n### Distributed downloading of the images\n\nWe download the raw images from the parsed URLs with asynchronous requests using Trio and Asks libraries in order to maximize all resources usage: vCPUs, RAM and bandwidth. We found that a single node in the cloud with 1-2 vCPUs, 0.5-1GB RAM and 5-10Mbps download bandwidth is inexpensive enough to allow downloading on a limited budget. Such a unit can process 10000 links in about 10-15 minutes. Each batch consisted of 10000 links taken from the Postgresql server by using the TABLESAMPLE technique, ensuring that the distribution among the 10000 links was following the distribution of the existing 500M records available on the database. We found that the distribution is still good when in the database are still above 20M records to be processed given that we had some 300 downloading workers at any time. The above techniques allowed both maximizing downloading speed and minimizing IP reputation damages.\n\n### CLIP inference at the post-processing stage\n\nThe data pipeline continued with GPU nodes doing inference on the collected image-text pairs, and calculating the similarity of the embeddings for the image and the text. After the similarity score was established we removed the pairs under the threshold we decided to use, i.e 0.28 for the English dataset ( with CLIP ViT B/32 ) and 0.26 for the rest (with mCLIP). As an estimation, we removed about 90% of the samples, trimming the 50+ billion of candidates to just below 6 billion.\n\n### Filtering out unsuitable image-text pairs\n\nAfter downloading the WAT files from Common Crawl, we apply the following filtering conditions:\n\n- All samples with less than 5 characters alt-text length or less than 5 KB image size are dropped.\n- All images with the too big resolution, potentially DOS bombs, were dropped before attempting to process them.\n- Duplicate removal is performed with a bloom filter based on URL. Future runs would include more variate deduplication rules, such as URL + language for the multilanguage dataset.\n- We use CLIP respectively MCLIP to compute embeddings of the image and alt-text. Then we compute the cosine similarity of both embeddings and drop all samples with cosine similarity below 0.28 for the English language ( with CLIP B/32) and 0.26 for the multilingual dataset (MCLIP). These thresholds were selected based on human inspection of the test results.\n- We use the CLIP embeddings of images and texts to filter out to the possible extent the illegal content.\n\n## Dataset preparation pipeline\n\nAfter processing and filtering common crawl, 5,85B of URL/text samples remained. We did additional steps after that in order to prepare the dataset. See this [semantic search blogpost](https://rom1504.medium.com/semantic-search-with-embeddings-index-anything-8fb18556443c) and the readme of [clip-retrieval](https://github.com/rom1504/clip-retrieval) for additional details about this process. See also [semantic search at billions scale](https://medium.com/@rom1504/semantic-search-at-billions-scale-95f21695689a) for more technical details of the process that was done for laion5B.\n\n1.  Downloading the data as webdataset with distributed img2dataset\n2.  Computing Vit-L/14 embeddings with distributed clip-inference\n3.  Computing a KNN index from these embeddings using autofaiss\n4.  Computing additional tags (NSFW and watermark) using clip embeddings\n\n### Distributed img2dataset\n\nWe developed the [img2dataset](https://github.com/rom1504/img2dataset) library to comfortably download from a given set of URLs, resize and store the images and captions in the webdataset format. This allows downloading 100 million images from our list of URLs in 20 hours with a single node (1Gbps connection speed, 32GB of RAM, an i7 CPU with 16 cores), which allows anyone to obtain the whole dataset or a smaller subset. For LAION-5B we introduced a [distributed mode](https://github.com/rom1504/img2dataset/blob/main/dataset_examples/laion5B.md) for this tool, allowing to downloading the 5,85B samples in a week using 10 nodes.\n\n### Distributed clip inference\n\nFrom these images, the [clip retrieval](https://github.com/rom1504/clip-retrieval%7D%7Bhttps://github.com/rom1504/clip-retrieval) inference tool was used to compute ViT-L/14 embeddings, allowing for a better analysis capacity of the data. In particular, a [distributed mode](https://github.com/rom1504/clip-retrieval/blob/main/docs/distributed_clip_inference.md) made it possible to compute these embeddings in a week using 32 A100: this larger clip model can only be computed at a speed of 312 sample/s per GPU, compared to 1800 sample/s for ViT-B/32. The resulting embeddings are available for everyone to use e.g. for clustering, indexing, linear inference.\n\n### Distributed indexing\n\nWe then used these 9 TB of image embeddings to build a large PQ128 knn index using the [autofaiss](https://github.com/criteo/autofaiss) tool. To make this run faster, a [distributed mode](https://github.com/criteo/autofaiss/blob/master/docs/distributed/distributed_autofaiss.md) is available.\n\n### Integration in the search UI\n\nIn order to demonstrate the value of this data, we integrated this index into the [knn search UI](https://knn5.laion.ai/). It is powered by the code called [clip back](https://github.com/rom1504/clip-retrieval). The knn index is 800GB and the metadata (URL and captions) as well, so memory mapping is used for both in order to use no ram, only an SSD drive of that capacity is required.\n\n### Watermark and safety inference\n\nWe wanted to give users the ability to remove unsafe examples, and watermarked examples. To do that we collected training and test sets. The training set was augmented with examples retrieved from the knn index, while the test set samples were selected to represent well the dataset distribution, but were all manually annotated. The inference is done using the [embedding-reader](https://github.com/rom1504/embedding-reader) module for NSFW and [LAION-5B-WatermarkDetection](https://github.com/Zasder3/LAION-5B-WatermarkDetection) for watermarks These tags were also integrated into the UI, allowing everyone to observe that the safety tags indeed filter out almost all the unsafe results, and giving confidence that training a generative model on this data will not result in unexpectedly unsafe images.\n\n### Watermarks\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/WQMTd03M8xmR8yTuSudnyZGgcQvcLfro4Lf0DXvIZb9P8xqjGJVPjrgziZ4U2HoHlgmY_3Ubx33qYaG5jIC-h_uuEOqyJ9K0IqJsNZH0XPiP1CDek8xz60fARNXpwJW9yCkEKa7u)\n\nThe training dataset is 90000 samples (45222 watermarks, 44778 clear).\n\nWatermarked images are a big problem when training generative models like DALL-E or GLIDE. To tackle this problem we trained a watermark detection model and used it to calculate confidence scores for every image in LAION-5B. Therefore we created a training dataset consisting of 90.000 images with 50% watermarked and 50% clean images. The majority of the watermarked images have been extracted from the LAION-400M KNN index through the use of several text prompts like “clip art watermark”, “cat watermark” or “landscape watermark”.\n\nThe images in the cleaned category were composed of images from the Open Images dataset and images that contained texts, but no watermarks, like PPT slides and memes, also retrieved from the kNN indices of LAION-400M. While we tried to curate a test set to evaluate the quality of our watermark detection model, we realized that it is almost impossible to draw a clear line between what actually is a watermark and what is not. For example pictures with small transparent texts at the bottom had been considered by some people as watermarked, by others not.\n\nIn the end we decided to choose a model based on our consensual judgment. It seems to be “good” at spotting obvious watermarks like those used on popular stock image sites. The creation of high-quality, openly accessible watermark detection test sets with clear and plausible definitions of what should be considered a watermark and what not, remains a challenge for future projects. Nevertheless we are convinced that removing images with a high confidence score for containing a watermark based on our model will significantly reduce the percentage of images that would be considered as obvious watermarks.\n\nThe model is available at [https://github.com/LAION-AI/watermark-detection](https://github.com/LAION-AI/watermark-detection) and [https://github.com/LAION-AI/LAION-5B-WatermarkDetection/releases/tag/1.0](https://github.com/LAION-AI/LAION-5B-WatermarkDetection/releases/tag/1.0)\n\n### Safety\n\nOn a balanced manually annotated safety test set with 3000 samples:\n\n- the accuracy of the B32 NSFW classifier is: 0.960\n- the accuracy of the ViT L 14 NSFW classifier is: 0.961\n\nThe model, as well as the training code, are available at [CLIP-based-NSFW-Detector](https://github.com/LAION-AI/CLIP-based-NSFW-Detector) The tags are available at [laion2B-en-safety](https://huggingface.co/datasets/laion/laion2B-en-safety) [laion2B-multi-safety](https://huggingface.co/datasets/laion/laion2B-multi-safety) [laion1B-nolang-safety](https://huggingface.co/datasets/laion/laion1B-nolang-safety) Demo at [clip-retrieval](https://rom1504.github.io/clip-retrieval/) (check/uncheck safe mode)\n\n## Using LAION datasets\n\nLaion5B and LAION-400M could e.g. be used to train\n\n- Generative models: training image/text generative models, e.g autoregressive models like DALL-E or diffusion models like GLIDE\n- Models with contrastive losses: self-supervised training on image/text pairs using contrastive losses, e.g CLIP\n- Classification models: e.g, performing zero-shot classification by extracting pseudo labels from queries on the dataset\n\nWe present here a few examples of models that were trained on our LAION datasets with success:\n\n#### CLIP\n\nWe, LAION, are currently working together with the Cross Sectional Team Deep Learning (CST-DL), Scalable Learning and Multi-Purpose AI Lab (SLAMPAI) at the Jülich Supercomputing Centre (JSC) and the Open CLIP team in the replication of OpenAI’s CLIP results.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lvN21OSxBEwmzj1H0eIa4RxpS_VEogmXxku8R_0LWSLWtDP_tfNPuKCPuBEzA2arDvyPVfZlACZhdgymssC5E0tp_aqPdUFJMOLQf3W0wZKx3LqpJKF4JViL_nrBQH6TxEn5H2i)\n\n( The results in the right column are from our model. – huge thanks to Cade Gordon \u0026 Ross Wightman for performing the training run )\n\nThe repository with the training code and the model checkpoints can be found here: [https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip)\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the Gauss Centre for Supercomputing e.V.

It was trained on a 115M subset of LAION-400M. To improve the results of the generated captions we (LAION) performed over 100 experiments to determine the hyperparameters that maximize the BLEU-4 score compared to MS COCO captions. Here you can see some of our [results](http://captions.christoph-schuhmann.de/eval_b_auto/eval.html).\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/pLpUwcYitBPvnLqApETmU0Ik4VVYkslTyuEZBXT8VByhMjGqINSdVPLpqOR6ZcdvCilLakTXJXP40xUecLMMCEIl7CpWAN2RfAHU__OAKcIyd3_8lrsWuKeQcraU86ITbWmxM-y_)\n\n_eval_best_auto0185: An orange cat is looking at its reflection in the mirror._\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/QCQjVFkxZAQf24yZ49q5RLQ3ElyCIMFlOy5ACsfC7QC-CLiDDhTdCSnn5sobHFOsxLrVUIpNrk9sPyVmYDL6NB8qyQP6aSfkgxDuoWdeT3JX3j5MuJOGC9b7UgxKKnl4X9l33d0w)\n\n_eval_best_auto0190: A green highway sign with the words Queens Bronx._\n\nWe found that we can significantly improve the quality of the captions by generating 40 (or more) candidate captions for each image and then ranking them using OpenAI’s CLIP ViT-L/14 \u0026 CLIP-Resnet50x64. First we ranked all candidates with ViT-L/14 and then we ranked the top-5 results again using Resnet50x64. Preliminary results of human evaluations indicate that:\n\n1.  our evaluators gave the generated captions an average quality rating of 3,8 on a scale from 0 to 5, with a standard deviation of 0,9 ( in this particular hyperparameter configuration n= 600)\n2.  our evaluators gave original human captions from MS COCO an average quality rating of 3,9 with a standard deviation of 0,8 ( n = 2100 )\n\n—\u003e We hypothesize that the generated captions match (\u0026 sometimes even surpass) the average quality of the human captions of MS COCO (which are sometimes also far from perfect) in most cases, but sometimes ( in less than \u003c10% ) contain obvious mistakes, that humans would not make, because deeper kind of world knowledge \u0026 „common sense“ would be necessary in those cases.\n\n#### GLIDE\n\nClay Mullis (alias [afiaka87](https://github.com/afiaka87)) used subsets of LAON-2B to fine-tune the OpenAi [Glide](https://github.com/openai/glide-text2im) model and managed to reintroduce human generations.

It demonstrates the diversity of images and captions that can be found in LAION-5B as well as high semantic relevance shows the distribution of image sizes of LAION-5B. Given the abundance of high-resolution images, one can produce subsets of images for training various customized models, and also choose image resolution that is suitable for the purpose of particular training.\n\n#### CLOOB\n\nKatherine Crowson and John David Pressman recently trained a CLOOB ViT-B/16, variant of CLIP, for 32 epochs on LAION-400M and got preliminary results, that come close to the performance of OpenAI’s ViT-B/32, even though this was an early run with unoptimized hyperparameters. The checkpoints can be found here: [https://github.com/crowsonkb/cloob-training](https://github.com/crowsonkb/cloob-training)![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ROxNOoa1jgaAW9JDbP2KHdDHOcTUCe-oPMvNTe2OYW_ETxbQI8W9YdA8oN93ULJ3r1Wyk7aAtm5GztJsQUZXUgw06BRiPECqp4o_bGXePp5cp9jFMBbbf2h1EYfDzvEHIcMdrcm-)\n\n(zero-shot accuracies on Imagenet-1K )\n\nWe are in touch with Andreas Fürst, one of the original CLOOB authors, and learned from him that their team is currently (at the time of writing) training a CLOOB ViT-B/32 with LAION-400M with optimized hyperparameters and very promising results so far (53% zero-shot accuracy on Imagenet after 7 epochs).\n\n## Papers citing LAION 400M\n\nAfter the release of LAION-400M, several papers used LAION-400M for image generation, text to image generation, image to text generation and text image matching:\n\n- [Vector Quantized Diffusion Model for Text-to-Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14822.pdf) used LAION-400M to train VQ diffusion text to image generation models\n- [High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752.pdf) used a subset of LAION-400M to train latent diffusion models\n- [General Facial Representation Learning in a Visual-Linguistic Manner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03109.pdf) LAION-400M face subset to train a face clip\n- [BLIP: Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training for Unified Vision-Language Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12086) image captioning using LAION-400M subset\n- [MAGMA – Multimodal Augmentation of Generative Models through Adapter-based Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05253.pdf) was trained on image question answering using a LAION-400M subset\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy releasing an updated version of an openly available dataset that contains 5 billion image-text pairs, we have set new Standards for the scale of openly available datasets and enable researchers from all over the world to train state-of-the-art language-vision models like GLIDE or Turing Bletchley. As proof of concept, we demonstrated that a subset of our dataset can be used to train various CLIP-like models, producing samples of sufficient quality. This dataset extends the possibilities in multi-language large-scale training and research of language-vision models, that were previously restricted to those having access to proprietary large datasets, to the broad community.\n\n## What’s next?\n\nThis is only the beginning! Now that this huge and open dataset is released, it can be used to train many models, such as gigantic clip models, image/text generation models and much more.

It was built for research purposes to enable testing model training on larger scale for broad researcher and other interested communities, and is **not** meant for any real-world production or application.\n\nWe have filtered all images and texts in the LAION-400M dataset with OpenAI‘s [CLIP](https://openai.com/blog/clip/) by calculating the cosine similarity between the text and image embeddings and dropping those with a similarity below 0.3. The threshold of 0.3 had been determined through human evaluations and seemed to be a good heuristic for estimating semantic image-text-content matching.\n\nThe image-text-pairs have been extracted from the [Common Crawl](https://commoncrawl.org/) web data dump and are from random web pages crawled between 2014 and 2021.\n\n### Download Information\n\n###### UPDATE 16 dec 2021\n\nWhile **the eye** experiences technical difficulties, we provide an alternate download server for this dataset at this link: [laion400m at deploy.laion.ai](http://deploy.laion.ai/8f83b608504d46bb81708ec86e912220/)\n\n###### Original information\n\nYou can find\n\n- The CLIP image embeddings (NumPy files)\n- The parquet files\n- KNN index of image embeddings\n\nTo download from **the eye**, run this command\n\n`aria2c \"https://the-eye.eu/public/AI/cah/laion400m-met-release.torrent\"`\n\nYou may want to use the `–show-files` and `–select-file` options to download only some files.\n\nYou can also find the files in [laion400m-met-release](https://the-eye.eu/public/AI/cah/laion400m-met-release/)\n\nSome more significant knn indices are present in [laion400m-indexes](https://the-eye.eu/public/AI/cah/laion400m-indexes/). We advise using the 128GB ones.\n\nThe parquet files in Kaggle: [laion400m on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/romainbeaumont/laion400m)\n\nAfter downloading the metadata as indicated above, you can run [this command](https://github.com/rom1504/laion-prepro/blob/main/laion400m/download_images/download_images.sh) to download the images and generate the webdataset files (command using [img2dataset](https://github.com/rom1504/img2dataset) )\n\n### LAION-400M Dataset Statistics\n\nThe LAION-400M and future even bigger ones are, in fact, datasets of datasets. For instance, we can filter it out by image sizes into smaller datasets like this:\n\n```\nNumber of unique samples 413M\nNumber with height or width \u003e= 1024 26M\nNumber with height and width \u003e= 1024 9.6M\nNumber with height or width \u003e= 512 112M\nNumber with height and width \u003e= 512 67M\nNumber with height or width \u003e= 256 268M\nNumber with height and width \u003e= 256 211M\n```\n\nBy using the KNN index, we can extract specialized datasets by domains of interest. They are (or will be) sufficient in size to train technical domain models.\n\nAlso, use [https://rom1504.github.io/clip-retrieval/](https://rom1504.github.io/clip-retrieval/) for simple visualisation of the dataset. There you can search among the dataset using CLIP and a knn index.\n\n### Disclaimer \u0026 Content Warning\n\nOur filtering protocol only removed NSFW images detected as illegal, but the dataset still has NSFW content accordingly marked in the metadata. When freely navigating through the dataset, keep in mind that it is a large-scale, **non-curated** set crawled from the internet for research purposes, such that collected links may lead to discomforting and disturbing content. Therefore, please use the demo links with **caution**. You can extract a “safe” subset by filtering out samples drawn with NSFW or via stricter CLIP filtering.\n\nThere is a certain degree of duplication because we used URL+text as deduplication criteria. The same image with the same caption may sit at different URLs, causing duplicates. The same image with other captions is not, however, considered duplicated.\n\nUsing KNN clustering should make it easy to further deduplicate by image content.\n\n### LAION-400M Open Dataset structure\n\nWe produced the dataset in several formats to address the various use cases:\n\n- a 50GB url+caption metadata dataset in parquet files. We can use the metadata to compute statistics and redownload part of the dataset\n- a 10TB webdataset with 256×256 images, captions and metadata. It is a full version of the dataset that can be used directly for training (this one is for internal use, you need to redownload images yourself due to licensing issues)\n- a 1TB set of the 400M text and image clip embeddings, useful to rebuild new knn indices\n- pairs of 16G, 32G, 64G and 128G knn indices (running in the web demo)\n\n#### URL and caption metadata dataset.\n\nWe provide 32 parquet files of size around 1GB (total 50GB) with the image URLs, the associated texts and additional metadata in the following format:\n\n\u003e SAMPLE_ID | URL | TEXT | LICENSE | NSFW | similarity | WIDTH | HEIGHT\n\nwhere\n\n- **SAMPLE_ID**: A unique identifier\n- **LICENSE**: Where we found a Creative Commons License in the image data, we named it here like, e.g. “creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/” – otherwise you’ll find it here a “?”\n- **NSFW**: we used CLIP to estimate if the image has NSFW content. The estimation has been pretty conservative, reducing false negatives at the cost of more false positives. Possible values are “UNLIKELY”, “UNSURE” and “NSFW”.\n- **similarity**: Value of the cosine similarity between the text and image embedding\n- WIDTH and HEIGHT: image size as the image was embedded. We downsized originals that were larger than 4K to 4K.\n\nThis metadata dataset purpose is to download the images for the whole dataset or a subset of it by supplying it to the very efficient [img2dataset](https://github.com/rom1504/img2dataset) tool.\n\n#### 10 TB webdataset with images and captions\n\nBy running the img2dataset tool, we can download a 10TB webdataset. It will resize all images at 256×256 resolution, will append the corresponding caption and will generate a collection of tar files (that dataset format is called webdataset) containing images, captions, and metadata and related parquet files containing the same metadata\n\n- 00000.tar of size 270MB containing at most 10k samples\n  - 0.jpg\n  - 0.txt containing the caption\n  - 0.json containing metadata such as the URL, the original width, the EXIF data, whether the image is NSFW\n- 00000.parquet of size 1.6MB containing the same metadata as the JSON file. Useful to compute statistics without reading all the tar files\n\nThe 400M dataset will therefore have 41455 tar and 41455 parquet files. This dataset purpose is to train multimodal models like CLIP or DALL-E.\n\n#### 1TB of clip embeddings\n\nThe clip embeddings are stored in NPY files next to parquet files in the same order. Since this dataset is much smaller than image one, each NPY file stores 1M samples. Each NPY file is 1GB, and each parquet file is 150MB. There are a total of 400 such files. The embeddings purpose is to compute statistics on the dataset, for example, using clustering or knn indices.\n\n#### Two small 6GB knn indices\n\nWe provide two 6GB knn indices built using the [autofaiss](https://github.com/criteo/autofaiss). We can use them to compute a subset of the dataset and, more generally, to search among it efficiently. See the search [web demo](https://rom1504.github.io/clip-retrieval/) of it. We can use the CLIP filter tool along with this index to produce subsets using search terms efficiently. We also provide two 16GB knn indices of higher quality.\n\n### What can we do with the LAION-400M dataset?\n\nVision and language modelling has been taking off in 2021. Here are some pointers about what this kind of image + text datasets unlocks and why it seems interesting:\n\n- Six months ago, OpenAI released two blog posts and papers, [CLIP](https://openai.com/blog/clip/) and [DALL-E](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/). Both models rely on a large amount of (text, image) pairs. They used an unreleased 400M pairs dataset.\n  - CLIP is a model that computes how related are a text and an image. It makes it possible to build large text to image search, and it makes it possible to create that kind of crazy text to image art [clip-art](https://ml.berkeley.edu/blog/blog/clip-art/). They released a small and medium version of the model but no training code.\n  - DALL-E is a model that directly generates images from texts. As can be seen from the blog post, it achieves awe-inspiring results that could directly impact the world for anything that needs drawing and illustrations. OpenAI did not release any model, even through an API\n\nSince then, various researchers have organised several efforts to replicate DALL-E. People gathered initially around this excellent DALLE replication repository [DALLE-PyTorch](https://github.com/lucidrains/DALLE-pytorch) with some fantastic results visible in the readme. More recently, as part of huggingface events, new developments have been achieved (see [DALLE-mini report](https://wandb.ai/dalle-mini/dalle-mini/reports/DALL-E-mini--Vmlldzo4NjIxODA) ), and an online demo is now available at [DALLE-mini demo.](https://huggingface.co/spaces/flax-community/dalle-mini)\n\nThe replication effort is still far from achieving the same performance as the original DALLE, and it seems possible to go even further. Some people also want to make a better CLIP to produce even better-generated art.\n\nA large part of the results that we can achieve with such models is thanks to a large amount of data. Before LAION-400M, the largest open dataset for (image, text) pairs are in the order of 10M (see [DALLE-datasets](https://github.com/robvanvolt/DALLE-datasets) ), which is enough to train exciting models but not enough to reach the best performance. Having a public dataset with hundreds of millions of pairs will help build these image+text models.\n\n### Analysis of the LAION-400M data\n\nWe annotated 3456 samples of the dataset and got the following results:\n\n- Correct positive NSFW: 4\n- Correct negative NSFW: 3371\n- False-positive NSFW: 73\n- False-negative NSFW: 8\n- Bad captions: 3 (0.09 %)\n\nThe matching is excellent, thanks to CLIP. We could improve the NSFW automatic tagging in the future; however, the NSFW total rate is low enough (less than 1%) to make this not an issue.\n\n## Technical Details\n\nThe dataset acquisition has into two significant parts:\n\n1.  a distributed processing of the vast (many PBs) Common Crawl datasets, which produces a collection of matching URL and caption\n2.  a single node much lighter post-processing of the data that anyone can run in a few days and which produces the final dataset\n\n### 1. Distributed processing of Common Crawl\n\nWe acquire the raw web data for the creation of our dataset from Common Crawl. Common Crawl is a non-profit organisation dedicated to providing a copy of the internet to internet researchers, companies, and individuals at no cost for research and analysis. They regularly release dumps of HTML-like data parsed from billions of public websites found [on the Common Crawl website](https://commoncrawl.org/the-data/get-started/). To create image-text pairs, we parse through the data from Common Crawl and parse out all HTML IMG tags containing an [alt text attribute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt_attribute). Common Crawl provides its data in several formats. For our purpose, we chose to use the data in the WAT format. The WAT files contain only the metadata of the crawled sites, which includes all links and IMG tags contained in the website. Parsing only this metadata is much faster than parsing the whole HTML text (provided in the WARC format).\n\n#### Downloading original images\n\nWe download the raw images from the URLs we parsed from Common Crawl with asynchronous requests using the libraries [Trio](https://github.com/python-trio/trio) and [Asks](https://github.com/theelous3/asks). They allow us to go multithreading for a single CPU. Usually, a home internet link will be exhausted by a single or two CPUs. A data centre node can scale up benefits from guaranteed internet speed with a multiprocessing pool much faster than a single CPU node. At this time, we were able to use 50 cores with a full, secured 1Gbps connection to the public internet. This bandwidth must be available to the downloading node, not shared among many nodes or apps. We have optimised the script for speed while mitigating various errors we encountered. Usually, to satisfy a high-end demanding node such as above, we must take additional steps to provide DNS caching capabilities. We found that the knot-resolver ran with two processes and configured with caching option can solve this problem.\n\n#### Filtering out unsuitable image-text pairs\n\nAfter downloading the WAT files from Common Crawl, we filter the samples in the following steps:\n\n1.  We dropped all samples with less than five character alt text length\n2.  We dropped all samples with less than 5 KB image size\n3.  We use continuously updated bloom filters to drop samples that are already in our dataset. The bloom filters deduplicate by concatenating the URL and the alt text.\n4.  We use continuously updated bloom filters to drop samples from URLs that had timed out previously and therefore seem unreachable (or at least not reachable in an efficient way)\n5.  We use OpenAI’s CLIP model (the ‘_ViT-B-32_‘ version) to compute the image and alt text embeddings. Then we calculate the cosine similarity of both embedding vectors and drop all samples with a similarity below 0.3. We chose this threshold after trying different values and using human evaluations of how well the texts fit the images. Lower values like 0.28 or 0.29 also seemed okay in many cases, but after further inspections, we decided to choose the conservative value of 0.3.\n6.  We use the CLIP embeddings of the images to estimate if their contents contain NSFW content. We do this by calculating CLIP embeddings for a list of image categories like, e.g. “selfie”, “illustration”, or “landscape”, which also contains categories that indicate NSFW content like “porn” and “sex”.\n7.  Then we compute the cosine similarities between the embedding image we are currently filtering and each of these category keywords. If the category with the highest similarity and the keyword with the second-highest similarity belong both to NSFW keywords, we tag the sample as “NSFW”. If only one of them belongs to an NSFW keyword, we categorise the sample as “UNSURE”. If both keywords with the highest similarities are not NSFW, we tag the sample as “UNLIKELY”.\n8.  In the next step, we look at all samples with either the “NSFW” or “UNSURE” tag and drop those with any keywords in their text related to kids, teens, or other semantically related content.\n9.  In step 8, we repeat the procedure of computing the cosine similarities from step 6 with the difference that we now use category texts that indicate contents semantically related to kids and teens on a CLIP embedding level. If either the highest similarity or the second-highest similarity between a sample’s image embedding and a text of the precomputed categories belongs to a text that indicates content related to under-aged persons, we drop this sample.\n10. Finally, we repeat the procedure from step 8 with texts semantically related to animal categories like e.g. “animal”, “bird”, etc.\n\nWe perform these rigorous filtering steps for NSFW with potentially illegal content because we cannot guarantee that the contents of Common Crawl are free of such. We feel obligated to try our best to filter out such content. Inspections of samples filtered out by steps 7 to 9 have shown that our filtering procedure is very conservative and produces many false positives (samples it drops, which are not problematic). This process is okay because the number of potential samples waiting for us to crawl is vast.\n\n#### System Architecture\n\nTo orchestrate the interactions of the many crawling scripts (called _workers_) in our project, we use a server that keeps track of processed WAT files and of which worker gets which unprocessed WAT. We call this orchestrating server a _tracker_. Its functions are offering jobs to both download workers and inference workers, confirming cleanup requests from the DL staging server, maintaining ACLs for the Bloom server, and some more. We also employ several staging servers as buffers for jobs on their way to the storage location. The staging servers continuously update filters in the central bloom server where we use RedisBloom for high-performance reasons.![](https://i.imgur.com/kxl4jJe.png)\n\n#### Workflow\n\nDuring the evolution of our crawling project, we applied two different workflows:\n\n##### Workflow 1 (_“Hybrid”_ – workers)\n\nThis worker performs all computation steps during one job and then submits the result to the staging server. It then queues the results for release to the storage area.\n\n##### Workflow 2 (_“CPU – GPU – 2 stages”_ – workflow)\n\nWe soon discovered that the best way to utilise resources is to split the workload into CPU + networking tasks (downloading steps) and GPU tasks (CLIP inference steps). Hence, the 2 stage approach uses “CPU workers” to download images, create image-text pairs, and save the intermediate result to a staging server. Then “GPU workers” pick up jobs, concatenate a number of them to group around 20000 pairs per final result file. The 2 stage workflow proved to be most efficient, with speeds up to 25 million pairs added to the dataset per day when using 100 CPU workers with one core and one GPU worker employing an NVidia RTX 3090 graphic card utilising all 16 lanes of PCIe bus. The GPU node also needs about CPU 24 threads to keep up with the GPU processing capacity.\n\n#### Removing abuse alerts\n\nDuring downloading, we encountered abuse alerts from manual and automated tools that protect websites. After some learning curve, we reduced most of the issues by employing these mitigation techniques:\n\n- By far, the most efficient one was to use centralised bloom filters that eliminate requests going to the duplicate URLs over and over. Of course, the efficiency of these filters dramatically depends on how fast they are updated and used by the workers. By definition, having multiple downloading workers performing jobs in parallel makes them prone to overlap requests to the same URL even if the bloom filters are up to date at the beginning of the job.\n- Therefore the second technique significantly reduced the problem of parallel workers via randomising the jobs at the tracker server level. While executing jobs in sequence (with the oldest WAT files from 2013), we discovered that adjacent jobs were overlapping considerably. When we randomised jobs, we saw a dramatic decrease in such overlapping.\n\n#### Who ran this?\n\nWe want to thank :\n\n- the [LAION folks](https://laion.ai/#team), via so many worker nodes everywhere in the cloud\n- [the data hoarders](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/oyta8q/crawlinghome_help_build_the_worlds_largest/) Reddit community\n- [the-eye](https://the-eye.eu/) community\n- as well as all our friends and relatives that did not know what they were helping with\n\nfor running the workers to produce this vast dataset in a few months.\n\n### 2. Post-processing of the dataset\n\nOnce the distributed pipeline has run, resulting in a sizeable caption+url dataset, it’s time to package it in the best way. The objective of this second pipeline is to produce a version of the dataset that is easy to use for multimodal training. For this, we built tools that anyone can run out of a collection of caption+url. The exact command line to run is available in [cah-prepro](https://github.com/rom1504/cah-prepro) (which uses mainly [img2dataset](https://github.com/rom1504/img2dataset) and [clip-retrieval](https://github.com/rom1504/clip-retrieval) )\n\n#### Pyspark preprocessing of the CSV files\n\nAfter a fast run of a script to [download the CSV files,](https://github.com/rom1504/cah-prepro/tree/main/download_csv) the first step of this post-processing pipeline is to do deduplication by url+caption. The first pipeline does some partial deduplication using a bloom filter, but it is approximate, and some duplicates remain. Doing that pyspark post-processing also makes it possible to reduce the number of metadata files from hundred of thousands to 32 parquet files of size 1.7GB. See this [deduplication script there](https://github.com/rom1504/cah-prepro/blob/main/deduplicate/cah_stats_spark.py). Pyspark would be an excellent way to do any further filtering, and we [provide](https://github.com/rom1504/cah-prepro/blob/main/deduplicate/compute_more_stats.py) an example to compute some statistics. The resulting output is 32 parquet files containing columns such as URL, text, NSFW described at the beginning of the post.\n\n#### Img2dataset\n\nOnce this set of 50GB parquet files has is ready, we can use the [img2dataset](https://github.com/rom1504/img2dataset) tool to download, resize and store the images and captions as [webdataset](https://github.com/webdataset/webdataset). This tool can download 100M images in 20h in a single node (1Gbps 32GB of ram 16 i7 cores), so anyone can run this for the whole dataset or a smaller subset. The format this tool outputs is a collection of tar files (that dataset format is called webdataset) containing images, captions, and metadata and corresponding parquet files containing the same metadata\n\n- 00000.tar of size 270MB containing at most 10k samples\n  - 0.jpg\n  - 0.txt containing the caption\n  - 0.json containing metadata such as the URL, the original width, the EXIF data, whether the image is NSFW\n- 00000.parquet of size 1.6MB containing the same metadata as the JSON file. Useful to compute statistics without reading all the tar files\n\nThe size of the tars of 270MB is when using the options of img2dataset indicated there [download_images.sh](https://github.com/rom1504/cah-prepro/blob/main/download_images/download_images.sh) (resizing all images to 256×256 with padding for maximum file uniformity and avoid losing information). If using different options, you may have larger or smaller tar files.\n\n#### Clip retrieval and autofaiss\n\nFinally, the tar dataset aims to compute and package clip embeddings and compute a KNN index over the clip embeddings. The [clip-retrieval](https://github.com/rom1504/clip-retrieval/) tool makes it fast to compute 100M embeddings per 20h with a single 3080 GPU, so it’s possible to rerun this part on the whole dataset or a subset at a low cost. The embeddings are stored in NPY files next to parquet files in the same order. Since this dataset is much smaller than image one, each NPY file stores 1M samples. NPY files are 1GB in size, and parquet files are 150MB. There are a total of 400 such files. These embeddings help build text and an image knn index using the [autofaiss](https://github.com/criteo/autofaiss) tool, making it possible to produce a quantised index of an arbitrary file. The chosen index type is 6GB, so it’s cheap for anyone to load and run fast (10ms) queries over the whole dataset. We also generated another kind of index of size 16GB. Thanks to memory mapping, it’s also possible to load it at no ram usage.
