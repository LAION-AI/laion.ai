LAION has a zero tolerance policy for illegal content. We work with organizations like [IWF](https://www.iwf.org.uk/) and others to continually monitor and validate links in the publicly available LAION datasets. Datasets are also validated through intensive filtering tools developed by our community and partner organizations to ensure they are safe and comply with the law.

## Recent developments and safety review of LAION 5B

Yesterday, we received a copy of a report from Stanford that claimed to find links to illegal content in LAION 5B. We are evaluating the report findings. In an abundance of caution we have taken LAION 5B offline and are working quickly with the IWF and others to find and remove links that may still point to suspicious, potentially unlawful content on the public web.

Our goal is to complete the safety review of LAION 5B by the second-half of January and will republish the dataset at that time.

## Open datasets enable AI safety

Our mission at LAION is to democratize access to AI resources and to promote responsible AI research. And we believe the safest approach is through open systems that empower the community to inspect and validate the resources we publish. Transparency and community engagement are essential to ensuring ethical standards and legal compliance.

We call on Stanford to share with us the hashes for the URLs to these claimed illegal content so we can improve safety for everyone and we invite the community to join LAION in the effort to build open AI systems for the betterment of the world.
