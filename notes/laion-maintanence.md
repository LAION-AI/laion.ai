LAION has a zero tolerance policy for illegal content. LAION and partners like [IWF](https://www.iwf.org.uk/) are working together to continually monitor and validate links in publically available LAION datasets. Therefore, links contained in LAION datasets are both validated through intensive filtering by tools developed by LAION and partner organizations that make sure all the links comply with the law.

## What is the LAION dataset update?

We would like to announce that we will conduct regular maintanence procedures, in case our cooperation partners signal links in LAION datasets that still point to suspicious, potentially unlawful content on public internet. We will also update datasets by new validated best practicies in safety filtering that promise further dataset improvement. During such maintenance procedure, the public datasets will be temporarily taken down, to return back after update filtering.

## What is the next maintenance procedure?

While currently there is no clear evidence for any links in the LAION datasets pointing to unlawful material, we would like to test the workflow for the maintenance procedure and follow the hints provided by our cooperation partners to update the datasets. We also will take the opportunity to test further new tools for dataset safety filtering developed by LAION & partners. Once the procedure is finished, we will provide the updated versions of the LAION datasets to the public.

The next maintenance procedure will be conducted on 19.12 and will finish approximately in the second half of January.
